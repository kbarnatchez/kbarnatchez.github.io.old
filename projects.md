Some stuff I've worked on in the past few years, mostly pointed towards topics in biostats, health economics and sports. Projects range in their seriousness, from school projects to journal papers to small apps for visualizing data. If anything catches your interest, feel free to click to associated link to the project!

### [Effects of the ACA's Employer Mandate on Businesses](http://www.colby.edu/econ/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2018/08/kb_thesis-4.pdf)
(My senior thesis!) Many people in the US depend on employer-provided plans for health insurance coverage, and in many countries universal plans are implemented through employers. The Employer Mandate, a policy embedded within the affordable care act, tried to move the US closer to this popular healthcare model by requiring firms with 50 or more employees to offer insurance plans, or else pay a fine. This project explores some of the potential long-term effects of the policy, such as 1) **is the policy effective in increasing overall insurance coverage?** 2) **are small businesses affected differently than large ones?**  and (importantly) 3) **under what circumstances are people better off under this policy?**

# Sports

### [Optimal 4x100 Relay Strategies](https://kbarnatchez.github.io/assets/kb_exchanges.pdf)
While at Colby I (mediocrely) ran on the track team. We had one of the better 4x100 teams in our conference, but with one caveat: we got DQ'd a LOT for failed handoffs, most notably at our conference championship meet where we finished the event in first, only to find out that we'd be DQ'd for a handoff that occurred just outside of the allowed boundaries. During the time that this happened, I was taking a math modeling course that focused on modeling strategies for sports. 

### RunPlots: Strava Data Visualization
A very lazily named RShiny app that gives Strava users numerous ways to visualize their runs that are not currently offered on the app.
