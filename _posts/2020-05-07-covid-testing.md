I made an interactive post to demonstrate why we need to be careful before considering policies that grant "the recovered" -- people who received a positive COVID test at some point in the past -- special permissions to return to work/volunteer in contact intensive positions. You can check it out [here](https://keithbarnatchez.shinyapps.io/covid_testing/).

The main takeaways:
- Sensitivity and specificity matter **a lot**. Even if tests have an average sensitivity of 99% and just a 1% false positive rate, the number of false-positives among all positives can be extremely high.
- We have a double-edged problem: when prevalence of coronavirus is *low* the likelihood of positive-test individuals being false positives is higher. While the likelihood of a positive-test being a false positive decreases as prevalence goes up, a high prevalence is a problem in and of itself. 
- Inevitably, letting "recovered" people return to workplaces will create a pool of people with a large share having *no imunity* (and perhaps a false sense of security that they do).
