# About

### me
I do research assistant things, currently for econ stuff. I like topics in spatial stats, Bayesian methods, and recently biostat methods in clinical trials/sequential treatment designs. 

I run sometimes. When I do I post on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/40930645).

### this site
- An attempt to motivate myself to be more productive and become a better writer.
- A place to post side/mini projects, like this one.

### Time

[An excellent movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/) starring Rachel McAdams, Domnhall Gleeson and Bill Nighy, this movie starts as a romantic dramady before morphing into a heartwrenching father-son <> in its final act. I cannot recommend it enough -- it's one of my favorite movies.
