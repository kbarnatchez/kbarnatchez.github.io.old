I'm currently a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. I plan on applying to biostatistics PhD programs for the 2021 academic year. My research interests include Bayesian applications to clinical trial and dynamic treatment designs, spatial statistics and causal inference. 

I really value the clear communication of statistical concepts and results. I maintain a blog covering various topics in biostatistics and economics -- some of my favorite posts include:

Before working at the Boston Fed, I studied at Colby College and competed on the track & field team. I still try to run frequently, and post most of my runs on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/40930645). Besides running, I've recently started getting into biking and I spend most of my other free time cooking and/or thinking about food.
